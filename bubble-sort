      if a[j] < a[j - 1]: #a[1]<a[0] for example position a[1]= 6 and a[0]=8 therefore a[1] is less than a[0] and while loop will run
         tmp = a[j] #temporary variable set as integer from position a[1]
         a[j] = a[j - 1] #integer from position a[1] is replaced with integer from position a[0] (which must be a higher number in an earlier place) so that it can be sorted in order of rising numbers
         a[j - 1] = tmp #now a[0] is given the temporary variable so that there positions are officially swapped and the smaller number should be at an earlier position
      j = j + 1 #j turns into 2 so that we can go through the full list
   i = i + 1 #i turns into 1 for same reason as above

print a #sorted list, sorted using Bubble Sort Algorithm
